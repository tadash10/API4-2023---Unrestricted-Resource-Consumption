1. Introduction

The API Rate Limiter Script is a high-level Python script designed to effectively manage and mitigate the "API4:2023 - Unrestricted Resource Consumption" problem. Satisfying API requests often requires valuable resources such as network bandwidth, CPU, memory, and storage. Additionally, services like emails, SMS, phone calls, or biometric validation may be accessible via API integrations and are paid for per request. Successful attacks that abuse these resources can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks or a significant increase in operational costs.

The API Rate Limiter Script implements a rate limiting mechanism to control the number of API requests made within a specified time frame. By leveraging the token bucket algorithm, the script ensures a smooth and predictable rate of API communication. The rate limiter prevents excessive resource consumption and optimizes API usage, thus reducing operational costs and enhancing the overall stability of the system.
2. Prerequisites

    Python 3.6 or higher
    Requests library (included in the standard library)

3. Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/api-rate-limiter.git
cd api-rate-limiter

(Optional) Create a virtual environment (recommended):

bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Usage

To use the API Rate Limiter Script, modify the configuration parameters in config.py to match your API settings:

python

# API configuration
API_BASE_URL = "https://api.example.com"
API_HEADERS = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}

# Rate limiting settings
RATE_LIMIT_CAPACITY = 100
RATE_LIMIT_REFILL_RATE = 10
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND = 5

Once the configuration is set, you can run the script by executing the following command:

bash

python main.py

The script will demonstrate how API requests are managed based on the rate limiting settings. You will see API responses logged to the console, and any errors, such as rate limit exceedance or API request failures, will be handled gracefully.
5. Error Handling

The API Rate Limiter Script includes robust error handling to gracefully manage rate limit exceeded errors and API request failures. When the rate limit is exceeded, the script will pause the API requests and retry after a short wait period, preventing potential disruptions and optimizing API consumption.
6. Logging

The script is equipped with a logging module to log API requests, responses, and errors. By default, the script logs messages to the console at the INFO level. You can adjust the logging settings in the logging.py file as per your requirements.
